# iosish_shaker [![pub version][pub-version-img]][pub-version-url]

üç∏ A widget that allows you to shake your widgets, just like the pin on iOS shakes on incorrect input.

## Why?

I use this exact animation pretty often. So instead of recreating it every time, I decided to move it to a separate package.

## How to use

### Install it:

```
dependencies:
  iosish_shaker: ^1.0.0
```

### Example

1. Create a controller:
```dart
final controller = ShakerController();
```

2. Use the shaker widget:
```dart
return Shaker(
  controller: controller,
  child: child,
);
```


3. Shake, shake, shake! 
```dart
await controller.shake();

// The future is released when the animation is completed.
// So you can perform some action right after if you want to.
```
